# Modernization of Legacy Code to C++20

This README document outlines the modernization of a legacy C++ codebase to comply with C++20 standards, improving code readability, maintainability, and adhering to best practices. The original code was not only outdated but also used non-standard C and C++ features.

## Original Code

The original code was written in C++ but used outdated practices and libraries. Here's a summary of the issues with the original code:

1. Use of Non-Standard Headers: The code used non-standard headers such as `<conio.h>`, `<process.h>`, and `<fstream.h`, which are not part of the C++ standard library.

2. Deprecated Header `<iostream>`: The code used `<stdio.h>` for input and output instead of `<iostream>`, which is the standard C++ I/O library.

3. Unsafe Input Functions: The code used the unsafe `gets` function for string input, which is prone to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

4. Outdated Class Syntax: The class definitions and member functions used outdated C++ class syntax.

5. Non-Standard Loop Control: The code used non-standard loop control constructs like `getch` for pausing execution, which is platform-specific.

## Changes Made

To modernize the code and bring it in line with C++20 standards, several changes were made:

1. **Header Inclusions**: Outdated and non-standard headers were replaced with standard C++ headers, such as `<iostream>` and `<fstream>`.

2. **Class Refactoring**: The class `product` was refactored to adhere to modern C++ class syntax, including proper encapsulation, member functions, and getters.

3. **Safe Input Handling**: Unsafe input functions like `gets` were replaced with safer alternatives, such as `std::cin.ignore()` and `std::getline`.

4. **Use of Standard Containers**: Instead of raw arrays, a `std::vector` was used to manage collections of products.

5. **File Handling**: The code was updated to use `std::fstream` and `std::remove` for file operations, ensuring better portability.

6. **Proper I/O**: The code now uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for user input and output, adhering to C++ standards.

7. **Loop Control**: Non-standard loop control constructs like `getch` were removed in favor of cleaner alternatives.

## Benefits

The modernized code offers several advantages:

1. **Safety**: Safer input handling mitigates the risk of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

2. **Readability**: Modern C++ syntax and naming conventions improve code readability.

3. **Portability**: Replacing non-standard headers and constructs makes the code more portable across different platforms and compilers.

4. **Maintainability**: Encapsulation and refactoring of classes make the code more maintainable and extensible.

5. **Conformance**: Adherence to C++20 standards ensures compliance with the latest best practices.

## Usage

The modernized code can now be compiled and run using a C++20-compliant compiler (e.g., g++ with C++20 support). Here are the basic steps:

1. **Compilation**: Compile the code using a C++20 compiler. For example:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++20 modernized_code.cpp -o modernized_code
   ```

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./modernized_code
   ```

## Conclusion

The modernization of the legacy code has made it more robust, safer, and easier to maintain, adhering to the best practices of C++20 standards. The code can now be built and executed on modern C++ environments. Further improvements and optimizations can be made as needed.
